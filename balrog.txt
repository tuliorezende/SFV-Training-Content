	- cr. mp (mid range)
	- st. mp (counterpoke, very strong now that it forces standing)
	- st. mk (counterpoke, whiffpunish with this)
	- cr. mk (low, stomp follow-up is unsafe on block, use to catch people walking away from you)

Character Specific Mechanic:

	Served From The Front	- Balrog has no crossup. Jumping over your opponent with Balrog isn't worth it.

	Coast to Coast		- By nature of his moveset, Balrog can naturally carry his opponent across the screen and into the corner.

	Flexible V-master	- There really isn't a wrong answer for which options to pick as your go-to.

Normals:

st. lp	(4/5/3)		- long range 4f light, good frame advantage on hit/block
st. mp	(5/2/0) 	- excellent anti-air button. Forces standing now!
st. hp	(12/0/-3) 	- Knockdown CC button, great range, decent footsie button, long recovery (19f)
st. lk	(3/2/1) 	- 3f check option, goes into his lmh target combo
st. mk	(6/5/2) 	- counterpoke button, special cancellable
st. hk	(9/7/3) 	- a big, chunky CC button (spin) with plus frames to spare, long recovery on whiff (22f)

cr. lp	(4/4/3) 	- native tick throw button
cr. mp	(6/4/2) 	- counterpoke button, buffer button
cr. hp	(8/-1/-5) 	- launching CC button, forces stand, good for heavy punishes and frametrapping
cr. lk	(4/4/1) 	- Low starter
cr. mk	(7/2/-2) 	- leads into the 2x stomp attack, and a good low medium poke. Good vt activation button
cr. hk	(8/D/-14) 	- Fast start-up sweep with decent range

j. lp	(-/-/-) 	- good hitbox to beat out low hitting anti-air buttons
j. mp	(-/-/-) 	- amazing air to air button
j. hp	(-/-/-) 	- horizontal hitbox
j. lk	(-/-/-) 	- can instant overhead the opponent
j. mk	(-/-/-) 	- far-reaching jump-in
j. hk	(-/-/-) 	- deep diagonal heavy jump-in attack, hard to anti-air.

Anti-Airs:

st. mp			- great anti-air, fast start-up, covers most jump-in options can struggle against cross ups
cr. hp			- a slower anti-air option which deals with cross ups. can only crush on first 2 active frames.
srk+mk			- used to catch neutral jumps at dash-straight range, can result in a trade or juggle combo.
j. lk			- jump back j. lk can be used against crossups

Target Combos:

st. mk xx st. mp	- Launching target combo... used mainly to go into vskills.
st. mk xx st. mp xx vs1 xx p or k	- into overhead/punch
st. mk xx st. mp xx vs2			- or into a KKB charge

st. lk xx st. mk xx st. hk	- 3f startup target combo, Balrog's 3f defensive option. unsafe on block.

cr. mk xx cr. mk		- balrog's low starter for v-trigger activations, nerfed severely in season 2 or 2.5
				- -7 OB, -2 when canceled into v-triggers. cancel from just cr.mk instead.

Specials:

vs1	mp+mk		- KKB
			- A spin that passes through fireballs, can be cancelled into two possible finishers
				- p finish, a straight attack, +2 on hit, -4 on block, leaves you close enough to 50-50 with a throw or low.
				- k finish, an overhead strike, +5 on hit, -7 on block.
			- Can cancel rush punch, rush low and TAP into KKB, allowing for mid-string mixups and optimal oki
			- Great for VT Activation 

vs2	mp+mk		- FFB
			- An install that empowers Balrog's next rush punch attack.
			- Empowered rush punches hit thrice, are plus on block (+2), and float the opponent
			- Empowered rush punches remove the charge timing restriction, allowing for instant rush punches off of b, f+p.
			- Can be cancelled into off of screw smash (srk+k), allowing balrog to get VS2 on deck after certain BnBs at the cost of oki.

v-rev	f+ppp		- Buffalo Headbutt
			- 17f v-reversal, knocks down, -2 on block.

rush punch, b, f+p	- Dash Straight
			- Balrog dashes across the screen and punches his opponent in the face.
			- Important to master using this at max-range as a poke, so that it cannot be punished.
			- Unmetered:
				- LP: +2 oh, -4 ob, starts up fastest.
				- MP: +2 oh, -4 ob
				- HP: +2 oh, -4 ob, starts up slowest.
				- Empowered, +2 on block.
				- Can be canceled at any time before the strike into VS1.
			- Metered:
				- EX: Knocks down on hit, +1 on block.
				- VS2 Empowered, +4 on block.
				- Can be cancelled at any time before the second strike into VS1 to start mixups
			- Startup frames are shaved off if you're point blank with the opponent
				- LP (12f to 10f), MP (16f to 12f), HP (25f to 19f), EX (22f to 9f)
			- Can be timed to be meaty to get additional plus-frames on hit, in addition to being able to follow up on counterhit dash-straights

rush low, b, f+k	- Dash Grand Blow
			- Balrog dashes across the screen and punches them in the shins
			- Also important to master the max-range so you can't be punished		
			- Low attack, results in a knockdown
			- Unmetered:
				- Startup depends on strength, all knock down and are -7 on block
			- Metered:
				- Knocks down, -2 on block
			- Startup frames are shaved off if you're point blank with the opponent

smash	srk+k		- Screw Smash
			- Balrog performs a forward moving uppercut attack that launches the opponent
			- Unmetered:
				- Whiffs on crouching opponents
				- Strength determines startup, and launch height
				- HK launches high enough for several followups
				- -10 on block for lk and mk, -13 for hk
			- Metered: 
				- EX Screw smash starts up in 12f, hits crouching opponents, and has armor from frames 3 to 16.
				- Monstrously unsafe at -17

TAP	2p/k		- Turn-Around Punch
			- Chargable move that passes through fireballs
			- Charge determines damage, frame advantage on hit, and invincibilites
			- Since TAP's nerfs back in s2.5, not a lot of people use this for its intended purpose, as vs1 usually serves the same purpose
			- Sometimes used a sort-of enhanced "dash" by cancelling it into vs1.
			- Used as a part of some optimal crush counter confirm combos (cc cr.hp, TAP, mp.dash straight)

CA	qcfx2+p		- Gigaton Blow
			- 8f startup
			- 1-10f full invincible, 11-13f projectile+throw invincible, 14-17f projectile invincible.
			- Passes through the opponent when mid-screen, resulting in a sideswitch.
			- Only a single hit, making his CA punishes against opponents that perform ex reversals incredibly damaging. Also great for chip-kills.

(vt2)
hp+hk		(+12)

(situations)
st. hk, st. mk xx st. mp xx vs1		(+38)
st. hk, st. mk xx st. mp xx vs1 xx p	(+35)

cr. hp xx srk+hk, b,f+lp		(+27)
	- too far to get anything outside of the corner by dashing (further than 1 dash away)
	- but, meaty max-range lk.dash-low is possible mid-screen
cr. hp xx srk+hk, b,f+pp		(+33)
	- too far to get anything outside of the corner (further than 1 dash away)
	- but, lk.dash-low kara-cancelled into vs1 on its earliest frame leaves you closer and +2

VT1:		Crazy Rush
		- 3 bar v-trigger
		- Activation is an install
		- The first of Balrog's robbery v-triggers
		- Allows balrog to cancel his rush punches/lows/smashes into followup rush punches/smashes
			- Up to 4 rekkas in a row.
			- Can be used to make all moves safe
			- f+p performs a followup straight
				- less damage, more stun, keeps opponent grounded
				- -2 on block universally, -13 for final attack.
			- f+k performs a followup smash
				- more damage, launches opponent, better spacing
				- universally -2 on block, -21 for final attack.
		- Can be cancelled into KKB (vs1) at any time into an overhead, punch, or nothing into throw/low
		- Results in strings with multiple standing mixups
		- Due to VT scaling, you will want to perform a standing reset somewhere in your string to reset the hit count and mix your opponent up.
		- An incredibly creative vtrigger, lots of options for mixups and damage. I can't begin to give you optimal routes, these will require external research or experimentation.

Activation Routes: (oh/ob)
	cr. hk			(D/+6)
	cr. mk			(+13/+9)
	ex rush punch		(+9/+4)
	ex rush low		(D/+5)
	vs1 xx k		(+19/+7)
	vs1 xx p		(+17/+11)
Example combo:
	cr. mk xx vt1, cr. hp xx srk+hk, b, f+p xx f+k xx f+k xx f+k	(271/415) (see how the scaling sucks?)
		
VT2:		No Mercy
		- 2 bar v-trigger
		- Activation is an install
		- Gives balrog a command grab off of hp+hk that can be combo'd into
			- cancels from any cancellable normal and cr. mk xx cr. mk as well as lk xx mk
			- 7f startup, knocks down
			- a staggering +350 stun if it connects
			- allows for command grab loops in the corner
		- vs2 empowered ex rush punches leave balrog close enough (and plus enough) to tick into this command grab.

Activation Routes:
	same as vt1

Example Combo:
	cr. mk xx vt2, cr. mk xx cr. mk xx hp+hk			(226/393)
