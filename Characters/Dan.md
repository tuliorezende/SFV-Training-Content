IMPORTANT DAN MATCH UP THINGS:

IF THE DAN PLAYER PICKS VS2. IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY HE WILL DO SOME BULLSHIT FROM STAND HK.
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO ACT AGAINST IT.

LETS GO OVER STAND HK CANCELS:
STAND HK xx STAND HP IS INTERRUPTIBLE BY EX UPPER
STAND HK xx STAND HK IS INTERRUPTIBLE BY STAND MP, YOU CAN JUST STRAIGHT UP PUNISH THE STAND HK THOUGH.
STAND HK xx CROUCH HP IS UNINTERRUPTIBLE, YOU WILL GET BOPPED IN THE JAW. YOU NEED TO JUST BLOCK AND PUNISH, OR WHIFF PUNISH
STAND HK xx CROUCH HK IS UNINTERRUPTIBLE, ONCE AGAIN, YOU WILL GET BOPPED, BLOCK AND PUNISH

Everything else has a massive gap or none at all. These are really important to be aware of.
